<h3 top-margin:10px;><b>NALMS International Symposium R Workshops</b></h3> 
<img src="./images/graphs.png" alt="">

Welcome to the <b>R4NALMS</b> homepage for R workshops at the International NALMS Symposium. This page hosts content for both the <b>Introduction to R for Aquatic Research</b> and the <b>Applications of R for Aquatic Plant Data</b> workshops being offered at the 2025 NALMS Symposium. 

The <a href="morning.html"> Introduction to R for Aquatic Research Workshop </a> (8:00 - 12:00 pm Monday November 4 2025) will be an introduction to <a href=https://www.r-project.org/> R </a> as a functional, vectorized, and object-oriented programming language. It will cover R syntax, how to read and write R code, types of variables and objects, functions, basic data load and management, descriptive statistics, and working with R packages like those included in the `tidyverse` for data summaries and plots. 

The <a href="afternoon.html"> Applications of R for Aquatic Plant Data Workshop </a> (1:00 - 5:00 pm Monday November 4 2025) will build on techniques in the introductory workshop to demonstrate a couple of in-depth applications with aquatic plant data for novice-to-intermediate R users. We will explore more advanced data management techniques, some common statistical tools, plotting, and spatial data through worked examples. Those less familiar with R should plan on attending both sessions. Those who have some experience using R are welcome to attend the afternoon session as a stand-alone module.

Personal computers are required for both sessions. <b>All software is freely available and should be installed prior to the workshop, especially if you require assistance with installation from your IT support group </b>. Please see <a href="software.html"> this page </a> for software installation instructions.
