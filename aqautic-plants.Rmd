Welcome Applications of R for Aquatic Plant data! This module will serve as a tutorial to help you understand how to improve your data and analysis workflows for aquatic plant data in R. 

**This Site is Currently Under Construction** We are working on updating this page with a brand-new, whiz-bang module about aquatic plant data! We'll be in touch with workshop attendees once it is ready.
